# 📏 Sort by Length

## The Challenge

Given an array of strings, sort them in order of increasing lengths. If two strings have the same length, their relative order must be the same as in the initial array.

For 

inputArray = ["abc", "", "aaa", "a", "zz"]

the output should be 

sortByLength(inputArray) = ["", "a", "zz", "abc", "aaa"]
