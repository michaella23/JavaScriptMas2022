# ðŸ‘½ Decode an Alien Message 

## The Challenge

We Come in Peace!  
We've received what (we assume) is a message of peace and brotherhood from an alien planet. They almost got it right, but the messages are backward. Write functions to reverse the backward messages so we can read what they have to say! 

## Functions to use

First function: Reverse a string
Write a function, reverseString(), that takes in a string and returns the reverse of that string. Use string methods, and/or try reversing a string manually. 

Example input: !htrae ot emocleW
Example output: Welcome to earth!

Second function: Now reverse all strings in an array. Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns a new array with all strings reversed.

Reuse the reverseString() function, use string methods, or reverse the strings manually.
