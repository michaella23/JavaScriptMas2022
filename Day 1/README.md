# Panic function 

## The Challenge
Write a PANIC! function. The function should take in a sentence and return the same
sentence in all caps with an exclamation point (!) at the end. Use JavaScript's
built in string methods. 

If the string is a phrase or sentence, add a ðŸ˜± emoji in between each word. 

Example input: "Hello"
Example output: "HELLO!"

Example input: "I'm almost out of coffee"
Example output: "I'M ðŸ˜± ALMOST ðŸ˜± OUT ðŸ˜± OF ðŸ˜± COFFEE!"
